# reServe


## Before Savvy Coders

I have diverse experience in a number of areas and disciplines, including a bachelor’s degree in linguistics, extensive experience in food service, and teaching. Immediately before beginning to code with Savvy Coders, I was managing 5 nutrition programs for a non-profit that serves as both a senior center and affordable housing for low-income older adults.

## reServe's Backstory
When I began working in social services, among the initiatives that I took upon myself was to digitize and automate a number of handwritten procedures for which I was responsible. Among those procedures was a meal reservation system, which was being done with a 5lb binder containing reservation lists for each day of the month, with accompanying handwritten notes. Aside from the inherent challenges of completely uploading a system from a physical location to a shared drive, there were a number of accessibility concerns, as well.
First, I needed to develop the reservation system in such a way that it would be intuitive for my coworkers to use.

The reservation sheets also needed to be printed each evening to be used as attendance sheets by older adult volunteers, so I needed to maintain their existing format so that the sign-in process would still be intuitive for clients to use and volunteers to manage.

Within a couple of months, I was able to create an interactive network of Excel workbooks that not only saved hours a day of work being done manually in a binder, but also went further in consolidating and automating reporting processes by exporting reservation and attendance data.

Eventually, the reservation system that I implemented began working so smoothly that I was able to pass it off to the receptionists at the front desk and maintain a consultory role in its operation when needed.

The process of conceiving, designing, developing, testing, re-designing, implementing user (i.e. co-workers) input and feedback, and eventually watching my system succeed and receive buy-in was a thrill for me! It was at that point that I decided to pursue coding and develop **reServe**.

reServe allows clients to make ongoing meal reservations for congregate meals (home delivery coming soon!) in a manner that suits their dietary preferences, restrictions, and schedules!

For example, one client might want to come to dinner every Monday and Wednesday ongoing, but not on days when red meat is being served. Another client might want to come to dinner every day that fish is being served, regardless of which day it was being served.

reServe:
- Allows clients, whether making reservations on their own, through a caretaker, or an office administrator, the flexibility to reserve meals that meet their needs and preferences, and the reassurance of receiving instant confirmation of their reservations.
- Allows clients or their caretakers to make reservations on their own, rather than necessarily rely on office administrators to do it for them. This not only fosters a sense of agency among the clients, it also saves a lot of time for office administrators.
- Provides administrators an easy platform to view reservations by client and date, giving a real-time tool to manage logistics for each meal in advance.
It creates a central repository for reservations, so no matter who is working or making reservations, client preferences, restrictions, and reservations are up-to-date, accurate, and easy to find.

Aside from efficiency, the main benefit of this app is its greater impact on quality of life for older adults. **reServe enables older to retain dignity through independence and access to vital social activities**. A key indicator of wellbeing among seniors is the ability to dine socially. A streamlined approach to meal reservations for older adults facilitates consistent participation in social activities, and frees-up both seniors and administrators to focus on fostering good health and prosperity in the process of aging.



# Design Architecture
reServe is designed mobile first in order to put reServe straight into the clients’ hands. Reservations are made using a "homemade" UI, Firebase manages daily reservations, menus, and client profiles on the back end, and JavaScript handles UX and facilitates interaction with the backend.
Plans to expand reServeinclude:
  - using JavaScript to populate a reservation and sign-in list, which will then be executed on screen as an expedited two-touch “signature” process (one touch next to the client’s name, another touch to confirm attendance)
  - facilitating home delivery (e.g. Meals on Wheels) by accessing the Google Maps API to route delivery drivers to clients receiving home delivered meals
  - Using the Google Calendars API to mark reservations in clients’ calendars

## The Value of Savvy Coders
I have always valued creativity and fast-paced problem solving, both traits which I have identified as prevalent among successful programmers and web developers. Through programming, I seek to creatively solve problems and improve lives, and I am hopeful that my hard work in Savvy Coders translates to marketable skills necessary to be hired in the competitive field of programming.
